# Time-Series-Forecasting-with-ARIMA-on-Global-Temperature-Data

I used Python to analyze historical global temperature data and apply a time-series forecasting approach. The data was cleaned and prepared, checked for stationarity, transformed where required, and modeled using ARIMA to predict future temperature values.

Python for analysis and forecasting

pandas & numpy for data cleaning and preprocessing

ADF test to check whether the time series is stationary

Log transformation and differencing to stabilize the data

ACF & PACF plots to select ARIMA parameters

ARIMA(1,1,1) to build the forecasting model

matplotlib to visualize trends and future predictions
